# Coffee Maker Project
In this project, I've implemented features of a coffee maker. Interaction is limited to a text-based experience on the console.
This coffee maker is purely fictional, and I have no intention of gaining any monetization from this.
### Functionalities:
- Dispenses 3 types of coffee: espresso, latte, & cappuccino.
### Requirements
- Asks user what type of coffee to make and lists the types of coffee the system can make.
- Maintains finite resources to make coffee: water, coffee, milk, money.
- If there is not enough resources to make user's request of coffee, deny the request with the reason.
- If there is not enough coins inserted by the user, deny the request with a refund.
- After processing the transaction, dispense the requested coffee. In addition, return the exact change of money to the user if any.
- For maintainers of the coffee machine, add two secret commands: 'report' and 'off'.
  - These commands are entered when the system asks the user what type of coffee they would like.
  - When 'report' is entered, the system will print all current resources (water, coffee, milk, money profited) on the console.
  - When 'off' is entered, the system will terminate the program.
