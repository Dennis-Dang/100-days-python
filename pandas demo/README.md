# Pandas demo
<p>This is not the typical project that usually post on this repository. Instead, this is a documentation of my 
exploration of using the pandas python library.</p>

<p>Initially, I've created a csv file (weather_data.csv). The data contains average temperature for each day rounded 
up to the nearest whole number, and their corresponding weather condition.</p>

<p>This demo will use data from this csv file to explore various common uses of the pandas library.</p>

## Learning Outcomes:
- Import csv file to dataframe
- Export dataframe to csv file
- Access certain data from specific columns or rows.
- Utilize pandas data analysis methods such as Series.mean() and Series.max()
