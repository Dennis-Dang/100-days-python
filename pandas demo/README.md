# Pandas demo
<p>This is not the typical project that usually post on this repository. Instead, this is a documentation of my 
exploration of using the pandas python library.</p>

main.py:
- <p>Initially, I've created a csv file (weather_data.csv). The data contains average temperature for each day rounded up to the nearest whole number, and their corresponding weather condition.</p>
- <p>This demo will use data from this csv file to explore various common uses of the pandas library.</p>
<br>

practice.py:
- Demonstrating what I learned of pandas, I'm going to practice with a dataset found online.
  - This dataset was created in 2018, where volunteers have combed throughout the New York Central Park to collect various information about the squirrel population there.
  - In this demo, I will use the pandas to count all squirrels that are gray, cinnamon and black (in fur color).
  - Additionally, I will export this data into a new csv file.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Import csv file to dataframe
- Export dataframe to csv file
- Access certain data from specific columns or rows.
- Utilize pandas data analysis methods such as Series.mean() and Series.max()
