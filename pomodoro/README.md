# Pomodoro App
This is a productivity app that helps facilitate study and break time. Pomodoro (Italian for tomato) is regarded as a 
time management technique where you alternate work sessions with short breaks to promote concentration and prevent 
mental fatigue.

By default, the Pomodoro is scheduled as follows:
- 3 sets of:
  - 25-minute of working
  - 5-minute break
- Then:
  - 25-minute of working
  - 25-minute break

How to use:
- Click the ▶ button to start the timer.
- Click the ⏭ to skip the session and continue to the next one.
- Click the Reset button to reset the whole schedule.
- After 1 set of working, a green ✔ will appear. This will keep a tally of the number of work sessions you've completed.

# Learning Outcomes:
- Solidify GUI development using tkinter module.
- Bind buttons with functions to make the app interactive.
- Use colorful palettes that complement each other for the design.
  - Color selection agrees with the color contrast ratio to enhance readability of text.
