# Pong game
<p>This is another classic retro game that I played in my early childhood.
Although I was not old enough to play it when it came out, Pong was one of the first retro games I played when my father
bought me the Atari Flashback 2 to play on our classic Mitsubishi CS-series CRT TV when we were still renting a small 
duplex. It was a memorable experience since these consoles and CRT displays are not so prevalent today to provide 
that classic retro gaming experience.</p>

<p>Allow me to present you my humble implementation of Pong.</p>
