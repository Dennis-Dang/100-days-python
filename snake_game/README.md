# Snake game
This is an implementation of the classic retro snake game.
## Specifications:

- Player can move the snake with the keyboard (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Snake can collect food to elongate itself, gaining more score points
- Snake cannot get tangled with itself or hit the wall, otherwise it's game over
- Goal is to eat as much food as you can while avoiding obstacles 

## Learning Outcomes:
- Use object-oriented programming (OOP) to compartmentalize the snake's feature into one class.
