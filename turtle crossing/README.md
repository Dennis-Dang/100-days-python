# Turtle Crossing game
This is my humble implementation of a Frogger-like game where the turtle has to cross 
a busy highway to get to the next level.

# Specifications

- Flow of traffic, or generation of cars should start from the right and move horizontally to the left
  - All cars have the same shape, size and speed
  - However, they all spawn in random colors
- Turtle can only move upwards in one direction
- The level number is kept tracked and printed on the top left of the screen
- After turtle finishes each level, they are moved back to the starting position to cross again
  - Difficulty is increased by speeding up the animation of the cars at the start of each level
- If the turtle collides with a car, it is game over
